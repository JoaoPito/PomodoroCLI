# Pomogotchi
![PomodoroCLI](../main/img/to_ma_to.png)

Pomogotchi keeps you company for your study or work sessions. Your Pomogotchi gets really angry when it is hungry and the only way to feed them is to do **work sessions** (careful when feeding them after midnight though...).

The name is based on the 90s Tamagotchi (in case you didn't notice), and the project itself is also based on it in hopes to help me (the developer) and hopefully you to spend more time studying and less time climbing mountains in Zelda.
