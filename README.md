# PomodoroCLI
![PomodoroCLI](../main/img/to_ma_to.png)

A Pomodoro Timer for study/work with an aesthetic non-distracting command-line interface.

## :tomato: Usage
It can be used with the command `./pomo`, this command **uses the program's defaults (45/15 sessions)**.
Using the command `./pomo x y` creates a pomodoro with a *x* minutes session and *y* break. (*x* and *y* are in **minutes**).

After that **press the spacebar** once to start your pomodoro session! :)

When a session ends it starts counting *overtime* until you **press the spacebar again to begin break time**.

## :garlic: Warning!
***This project is still in early stages!***
Rotten tomatoes may appear.

There is still some work to be done:
- [ ] User Interface
- [ ] Arguments
- [ ] Session Settings/Default Settings customization
